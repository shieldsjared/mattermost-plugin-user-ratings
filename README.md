# Mattermost User Reputation Plugin

This plugin allows teams to denote specific emoji reactions as reputation bearing, and tracks users reputations. Simply configure which 
reactions your team wants to track, and then as user's posts are reacted to with these emoji, they will receive reputation points.

**This plugin is very much so in it's infancy stages, and is also dependent on this [pull request](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/pull/15765) 
before it can be released.**

## Development
